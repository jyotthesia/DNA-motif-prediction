# DNA Sequence Motif Prediction Using CNNs

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources developed during my internship at IIT Roorkee. The project focuses on predicting DNA sequence motifs bound by transcription factors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal was to develop a robust model that can accurately identify binding sites from ChIP-seq data, leveraging computational techniques and deep learning.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Retrieval:** Acquired ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE database.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Processed and prepared the raw sequence data for analysis, including sequence extraction, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model Development:** Designed and implemented a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras for DNA sequence motif prediction.
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuned hyperparameters and utilized advanced techniques to enhance model accuracy and performance.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
- **Results Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the model's predictions and identified key motifs that are strongly associated with transcription factor binding.
